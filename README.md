The is a pair of eyes that will follow your mouse. It was an exercise for week 8 of MIT's Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Developing with MERN. The code was provided with 1 eye and I had to add another eye so you had 2 eye balls watching your mouse move.

# Installation
To run this program
- you will need to download the HTML, JavaScript and CSS files to your computer
- run them in your environment of choice. I ran these and tested with VS Code.

# Road Map
This program doesn't really have the applications that warrant future improvements. It isn't an app or some other kind of functional program where you can add more functionality to it as needed.
